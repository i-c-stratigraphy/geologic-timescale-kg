    dcterms:description """The Geologic Timescale Knowledge Graph (GTKG) is a packaging of the next-generation version of the [Geologic[al] Timescale](http://resource.geosciml.org/vocabulary/timescale/gts2020). Until now, multiple date-based releases of the Geologic Timescale data without integration have existed however the GTKG incorporates all releases of the Timescale within one integrated dataset. It also includes a _master_ timescale which is a version-independent, abstract version of the Timescale.

This version, when complete, is expected to be endorsed as the point-of-truth geologic timescale data by the [International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)](https://stratigraphy.org).

Currently (September, 2021) there is no data in the GTKG yet, but there will be soon!"""@en ;
