# Geologic Timescale Knowledge Graph

_**NOTE**: The following statement about what this repository is, is aspirational. This might become real if/when the ISC officially sponsorts this product._

This is the official data for the [International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)](https://stratigraphy.org/)'s geologic timescale which is used to generate all versions of the [International Chronostratigraphic Chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart) and other, related, dataset, such as the [Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points (GSSP) table](https://stratigraphy.org/gssps/).

This Knowledge Graph (KG) is presented as a [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), multi-part, dataset in which the multiple models and also the data created according to those models are formulated in in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).


## Content

This repository contains both the content of the GT KG and supporting materials. The content is arranged like this:

* `docs/` - documentation
* `rdf/` - the RDF Seamntic Web content of the models and data of the GT KG
* `resources/` - supporting resources of multiple sorts

The KG itself has an identity that is separate from the individual elements within it. The IRI for the KG itself which is also the base for structural elements of it (i.e. not the data of the KG or the ontologies used) is:
