# Geologic Timescale Knowledge Graph

_**NOTE**: The following statement about what this repository is, is aspirational. This might become real if/when the ISC officially sponsorts this product._

This is the official data for the [International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)](https://stratigraphy.org/)'s geologic timescale which is used to generate all versions of the [International Chronostratigraphic Chart](https://stratigraphy.org/chart) and other, related, dataset, such as the [Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points (GSSP) table](https://stratigraphy.org/gssps/).

This Knowledge Graph (KG) is presented as a [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), multi-part, dataset in which the multiple models and also the data created according to those models are formulated in in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).
